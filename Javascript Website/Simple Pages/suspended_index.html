    <h3>Your account is permanently suspended. You are prohibited from accessing this website using this 
        account.</h3>
    <h3>You were likely suspended based on the 3-warning policy. You accumulate warnings through...</h3>
    <p>1. Violating Community Guidelines on the Forum.</p>
    <p>2. Receiving complaints from other users the Store Manager validated.</p>
    <h3>Although unlikely, you could've been suspended by the 1-strike policy. This involves...</h3>
    <p>1. Judgment from the Store Manager. Without warning, a Store Manager can suspend any user
          account instantaneously. The crime must've been severe to warrent this type of
          suspension.</p>
    <h3>IMPORTANT: If you still had a balance on your account upon suspension, please get in contact
        with a Store Manager. You may be entitled to get your money back. To reach a Store Manager,
        please make a new account and create a post describing your situation. Wait for a comment from
        the Store Manager.
