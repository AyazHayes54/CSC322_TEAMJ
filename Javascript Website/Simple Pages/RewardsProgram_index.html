    <h3>Valued customers will be given greater privileges toward the marketplace/checkout sections of 
        PC Emporium.</h3>
    <h3>Ways a customer can gain access to the Rewards Program:</h3>
    <p>1. Spending <strong>$2000</strong> on marketplace items.</p>
    <p>2. Spending <strong>$1500</strong> on marketplace items. Leaving a <strong>thorough review</strong> 
          of each verified purchase in the Forum. A thorough review has a post length of 2000+ characters.</p>
    <p>3. Spending <strong>$1000</strong> on marketplace items. Leaving a <strong>thorough review</strong> 
          of each verified purchase in the Forum. Sending a <strong>formal complaint</strong> that was 
          successfully confirmed by the Store Manager.</h3>
    <p>4. Paying a <strong>one-time fee of $250</strong>.</p>
    <h3>Actual details of the Rewards Program:</h3>
    <p>1. One time only, the user can submit a <strong>price match</strong> for a specific product. 
          This form would just 2 text boxes, one for productID and one for a link to an alternate seller. 
          If the Store Clerk can confirm that the link shows a different website selling the same item 
          but at a lower price, the price of the item in the Marketplace will be updated to match that 
          website. Otherwise, the price match will be denied and the Store Clerk can send one of two 
          messages back to the user: <i>‘Invalid Website’</i> or <i>‘The item from the alternate seller is 
          not the same as the specified Marketplace item’</i>. Even if denied, the one-time price match 
          privilege is used up.</p>
    <p>2. Get 10% off 5 products each month on checkout.</p>
    <p>3. <strong>Refund privileges</strong>. If the user is not satisfied with a purchase, send the item back to the 
          Marketplace. Once received, the user would see a balance increase by the price of that item. 
          Proof of this refund would be through a receipt to the user.</p>
    <p>4. At spontaneous times, the user will receive a <strong>multiple choice question</strong> about 
          future items the website should add to the Marketplace. The user can show preference toward specific 
          items or manufacturers. The Store Clerk/Manager would take this input into account for future decisions.</p>
    <p>5. Access to <strong>customer service</strong>.</h3>
